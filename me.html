			<a><b>How did the journey began?üßê</b></a><br>
			<a>The story began in early 2024, where I found myself constantly going back and forth, searching my papers for my hundreds of passwords, 
				notes and IDs to complete all sorts of tasks that require them. I needed a place in my computer to store all of them, securely and the
				way I wanted. Now, I could make use of a password manager but, my research showed that many assumed trusted, paid, online service
				providers of this kind have gone through data breaches with many sensitive user information now out in the wild. Personally I feel that
				the most secure place to put your sensitive information is either at a hidden physical sheet of paper or on a flash drive in encrypted 
				form. And this is where I got the idea...<br><br>
